Here I'll post an overview of what I have done on GitHub. Currently this is just in the testing phase, but I hope to make seperate pages for each project and an explanation of what I've done. I probably won't post my CV here though as I want to keep it secure. This is built using https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/contrast which inlcudes features such as code snippets and more. The information working with Jekyll can be found below. 

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
